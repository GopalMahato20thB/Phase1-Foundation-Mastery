# 1. Classes and Objects

## Explanation

In Python, Class is a blueprint of creating objects. It defines attributes(data) and methods(functions) that the object will have.
An object is an instance of a class, representing a specific entity with its own state.
Classes are defined using class keyword, and objects are created by calling the class like a function.


## Practice Problems
- 1. Create a class Person with attributes name and age . Initialize them in the constructor and
add a method greet that prints a greeting message including the name and age.
- 2. Define a class Book with attributes title , author , and year . Create two objects from this
class and print their details.
- 3. Build a class Rectangle with attributes length and width . Add a method area to
calculate and return the area of the rectangle. Test it with an object.
- 4. Create a class Student with attributes name and grades (a list). Add a method
average_grade that computes the average of the grades. Instantiate an object and call the
method.
- 5. Design a class Car with attributes make , model , and year . Add a method display_info
that prints all attributes. Create an object and demonstrate.
